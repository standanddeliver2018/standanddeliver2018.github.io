# Team Stan'd and Deliver

We are Rich, Dan and Ben - three previously unrelated guys brought together by the desire of achieving what most would consider a really bad idea: hopping into a dreadfully inappropriate car attempting to drive all the way from the UK to Mongolia in the name of charity and adventure.

This endeavour will see us crossing 10,000 miles for 6 weeks through some of the most inhospitable driving terrain on the planet - including 20 countries, 8 time zones, 5 mountain ranges and countless potholes.

We’re not doing this just to spite our mothers. We’ve partnered up with four great charities: WaterAid, Cool Earth, Mind and MNDA. They focus on projects that are close to our hearts: water, environment, mental and physical health.

Our goal is to raise a total of £3,000 to help support their work. Click on the fundraising link to find out more about the charities and how you can help us reach our goal.
